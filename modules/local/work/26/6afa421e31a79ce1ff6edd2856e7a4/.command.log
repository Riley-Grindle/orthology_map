WARNING: THIS IS UNCOMMON, there are zero hits when searching the genes in species 0 against itself. Check the input proteome contains all the genes from that species and check the search program is working (default is diamond).

Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 7907 genes (91.6% of total) to 1772 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 5 or more genes (G50 was 5) and were contained in the largest 503 orthogroups (O50 was 503). There were 1 orthogroups with all species present and 0 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
