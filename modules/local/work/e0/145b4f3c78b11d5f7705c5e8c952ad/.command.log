Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 7913 genes (91.7% of total) to 1774 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 5 or more genes (G50 was 5) and were contained in the largest 503 orthogroups (O50 was 503). There were 712 orthogroups with all species present and 310 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
